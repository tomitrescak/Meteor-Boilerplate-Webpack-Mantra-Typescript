## Cordova
You need to do those 3 steps to make it works with iOS or Android:

1. Add the platform to your Meteor project

    ```javascript
    meteor add-platform ios
    meteor add-platform android
    ```
1. Allow access to your dev server in your `/mobile-config.js` file:

    ```javascript
    App.accessRule('http://192.168.1.100:3500/*');
    ```

1. Replace localhost by your local ip address in `/entry/webpack.conf.js`.
